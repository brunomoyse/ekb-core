## About the project

This app is the UI part of a project sending messages to an insurance company customers to notify them that their subscription is about to expire.
A Laravel job (CRON task) is made to notify them automatically a certain period before the expiration but the user can decide to notify earlier via the UI, or edit the customers data.
